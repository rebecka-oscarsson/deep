# Deep/talk

A chat app where you can be a sea creature swimming around in the deep, talking.\
I believe this will be the next big thing in social media.\
I am using [socket.io](https://socket.io/) for live communication and [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for image upload.\
My backend-repo for this is the one called [chat_backend](https://github.com/rebecka-oscarsson/chat_backend)

Amazing features to be added are:
- Collision detections to stop the creatures from sitting on top of each other
- Private chatrooms
- An AI chat-bot-fish
- More vector-graphic avatars with nicer swimming-animations

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
